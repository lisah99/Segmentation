# Segmentation

# This is my own segmentation project for a COVID-19 lung dataset gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/covid19-ct-scans. 
# The main goal of this project was to get more familiar with medical data formats and associated libraries to deal with these formats (e.g. nibabel), as well as take a deeper look at data preprocessing for medical deep learning tasks. 

# The file was written in and for the GoogleColab environment.
